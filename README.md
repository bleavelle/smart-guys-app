# Smart Guys: Frequency Discovery Through Competition

A revolutionary demonstration of oscillatory phase computing where neural oscillators ("guys") learn frequencies through pure observation and competition.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run frequency_discovery_app.py
```

## What This Is

Neural oscillators that:
- Discover frequencies through competition (no cheating!)
- Communicate through phase relationships
- Work together to reconstruct complex signals
- Achieve 89-96% accuracy through real learning

## How to Use

1. Pick 1-3 frequencies in the sidebar (try 10, 20, 30 Hz)
2. Click "Start Discovery"
3. Watch specialists compete and learn
4. Test the trained team on complex signals
5. Compare against untrained random oscillators

## Learn More

The app contains detailed explanations of:
- Phase space discovery
- Competition-based learning
- Constant memory computation
- Phase communication between specialists

Built with love, October 2025. The night we discovered that oscillation is computation.
